This is the official Django agent for [Auklet][brochure_site]. It officially supports Django 1.7+, and runs on most POSIX-based operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu Core, Raspbian, QNX, etc).

## Features
- Automatic report of unhandled exceptions
- Location, system architecture, and system metrics identification for all issues

## Quickstart
To install the agent with _pip_:

```bash
pip install django-auklet
```

To setup Auklet monitoring for you application simply include it in your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'auklet',
    ...,
)
```

Then go and create an application at https://app.auklet.io/ to get your
config settings:

```python
AUKLET_CONFIG = {
    "api_key": "<API_KEY>",
    "application": "<APPLICATION>",
    "organization": "<ORGANIZATION>"
}
```

### Authorization
To authorize your application you need to provide both an API key and app ID. These values are available in the connection settings of your application as well as during initial setup.


### Optional: Release Tracking
You can track releases and identify which servers are running what variant of code. To do this, you may provide the git commit hash of your deployed code and a version string you can modify. This release value should be passed into the settings variable through the release key, and your custom version should be passed via the version key. The release value must be the git commit hash that represents the deployed version of your application. The version value is a string that you may set to whatever value you wish to define your versions. Please note that you can provide either a release value, version value, or both.
* Providing <strong>release</strong> enables code snippets to be shown for identified errors if you’ve linked your GitHub.
* Including <strong>version</strong> allows you to track what version of code had the issue.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.auklet.io/v1/releases/ \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -H "Authorization: JWT <API_KEY>" \
            -d '{"application": "<APP_ID>", "release": "'$(git rev-parse HEAD)'", "version": "<YOUR_DEFINED_VERSION>"}'
```
You can get a pre constructed curl request from the setup directions at [Auklet][https://app.auklet.io/]

```python
AUKLET_CONFIG = {
    "api_key": "<API_KEY>",
    "application": "<APPLICATION>",
    "organization": "<ORGANIZATION>",
    "release": "<GIT_COMMIT_HASH>",
    "version": "1.2.3"
}
```

### Middleware Error Handling
To set up default Django middleware error handling, add the Auklet middleware to the end of your middleware configs:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = (
    ...,
    "auklet.middleware.AukletMiddleware",
)
```

If you are already using an error handling middleware which returns a response, you need to disable it or do the following before you return a response; this ensures that the signal is sent to the Auklet middleware.

```python
got_request_exception.send(sender=self, request=request)
```
